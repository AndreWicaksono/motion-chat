Engagement Layer → XP, levels, achievements
Surprise Layer   → Power-ups, mystery rewards
Social Layer     → Reactions, streaks, combos
Discovery Layer
```

### **Emotional Design**

- **Anticipation**: Variable response timing and mystery rewards
- **Achievement**: Visual celebrations and progress tracking
- **Connection**: Personalized AI responses and mood adaptation
- **Discovery**: Hidden commands and unlockable features
- **Investment**: Progression systems that create attachment
